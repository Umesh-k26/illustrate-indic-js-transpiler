**Case study on how one can adopt Jison library for creating JS based Transpilers of our own choice of  lipi/keywords/texts**
------------

The idea here is we show that how one can generate JS parser for the keywords or lipi or text of your choice. Here we extend the JavaScript grammar with our own lexfile that has lipi/texts/keywords of our own choice. The grammar shipped here covers the whole JS grammar. The current shipped code generates the **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)** before generating final JS (Transpiled) code. However the **AST** generation is only for few constructs. If you which you could extend the same for other constructs as well.

**Why Jison and not build our own JS Transpiler for the lipi/text/keywords of our choice ?**
------------
 - Better code maintenance since the parser is generated by the Jison Library
 - Better performance
 - Time to build the transpiler is quick.

Installation
------------
Jison can be installed for [Node](http://nodejs.org) using [`npm`](http://github.com/isaacs/npm/)

Using npm:

    npm install jison -g

Generate parser for your own lipi/text/keywords
-----------------------
 1. Clone the github repository for examples:
```
a) git clone https://github.com/Umesh-k26/indic-js-transpiler.git
b) cd indic-js-transpiler
```
 2. Generate parser for your own set of lipi/keywords. Fro this you need to create at lex file containing your own set of lipi's/keywords. ***Refer:*** src/examples/ for the sample lex files (*.l).

```
Usage: jison [file] [lexfile] [options]

file        file containing a grammar
lexfile     file containing a lexical grammar

eg: jison jscore.jison hindi_js.l -o parser.js
```
