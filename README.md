**Case study on generating JS Transpiler based on custom lipi/keywords/texts & AST generation**

The idea here is we show how one can generate JS parser / AST for the custom keywords or lipi or text of your choice. Here we extend the JavaScript grammar with our own lexfile that has lipi/texts/keywords of our own choice. The grammar shipped here covers the whole JS grammar. The current shipped code generates the **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)**. However the **AST** generation is only for few constructs. If you which you could extend the same for other constructs as well.

**Why Jison  ?**
 - Better code maintenance since the parser is generated by the Jison Library
 - Better performance
 - Time to generate the parser is quick (Since its generated by Jison library).

Installation
------------
Jison can be installed for [Node](http://nodejs.org) using [`npm`](http://github.com/isaacs/npm/)

Using npm:

    npm install jison -g

JS Transpile based our own lipi/text/keywords
-----------------------
 1. Clone the github repository for examples:
```
a) git clone https://github.com/Umesh-k26/indic-js-transpiler.git
b) cd indic-js-transpiler
```
2. Transpile Steps

If you wish to include your on set of keywords/lipi.
under languages create a new file by coping the content from hindi.js. Replace the keywords to your own custom keywords. Also name the new file reflecting the lipi or the language.

```
node index.js -f <input file> -l <language>
eg: node index.js -f sample.js -l hindi

The output of the above command would generate a file output_sample.js
```

Generate AST
-----------------------

 2. Generate AST for the javascript. ***Refer:*** src/examples/ for the sample lex files (*.l).

```
Usage: jison [file] [lexfile] [options]

file        file containing a grammar
lexfile     file containing a lexical grammar

eg: jison jscore.jison hindi.l -o parser.js
```
